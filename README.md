# python_api_challenge  
Data Analytics Bootcamp Challenge 6  
This task requires the use of API from 'openweather' to create plots analysing the relationships between weather condition and city coordinations.  
The use of API from 'geoapify' is required as well to integrate with geoview in python to find the nearest hotel of a given city coordinations.  
To decide which cities are taken into the dataset, a random generator is used integrating citypy (pre-installed into env).  
The file 'Output data' contains plots for the weather part.  
.gitnore is used to conceal the api key used due to confidential matters.
